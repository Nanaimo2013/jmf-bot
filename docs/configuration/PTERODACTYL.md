```json
{
  "pterodactyl": {
    "enabled": true,
    "url": "https://panel.yourdomain.com",
    "apiKey": "your-api-key",
    "clientApiKey": "your-client-api-key",
    "updateInterval": 60
  }
}
```

## Commands

### Admin Commands

- `/pterodactyl status` - Check the status of the Pterodactyl panel
- `/pterodactyl servers` - List all servers on the panel
- `/pterodactyl user <user>` - Get information about a user's servers

### User Commands

- `/server list` - List your servers
- `/server info <server>` - Get detailed information about a server
- `/server start <server>` - Start a server

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Pterodactyl integration, check the following:

1. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
2. Verify the panel URL is correct and accessible
3. Check the bot logs for any error messages
4. Ensure the bot has the necessary Discord permissions

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be kept secure and never shared
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Limit the permissions of the API key to only what is necessary
